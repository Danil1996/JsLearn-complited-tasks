# Learn JS or how will I become a programmer

I created this project for learning JavaScript, nodeJs, git and all sorts of other things that will help me in my difficult beginning/ continuation.

## Get Started

---

There will be some instructions for installing and running my project, which I will change depending on the growth of my knowledge and the project as a whole.

## Installing and Running

---

In order to run my code, first you need to download it, follow the link from the git.

Then you need only one commande:

```
node <name of file>
```

## Technologies in the project

First, I will start by performing tasks from the site [Learn JS](https://javascript.info). I will do it in a new branch. Then I will make a pull request and assigned to to my friend @mephistopheles1010 and he will check my tasks, coding style and literacy of git, after which they will be added to the main branch or my request will be denied and I will redo everything based on advice and comments from my comrade.
